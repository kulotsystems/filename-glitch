## Filename Glitch
HTML file demo showing differences between local
and GitHub Pages execution.

Windows displays "Hello world!" but it fails to display on
Linux-based server like GitHub Pages.
See demonstration at <https://kulotsystems.github.io/filename-glitch>.

Markup issue:
```html
<script src="Main.js"></script>
```
